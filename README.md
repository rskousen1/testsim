TestSim by Richard Skousen crudely simulates a Windows 10 desktop environment. It is limited in its functionality, and at the current time only allows the user to click on the Settings and Windows Explorer icons in the task bar, which will bring up their respective windows. When the Settings window appears, the user can click on Status, Wifi or Ethernet in the side bar. The Windows Explorer allows the user to click on Desktop, Documents, Downloads and Music in the side bar. Windows can be moved by using the top menu bar. And they can be closed by clicking on the X in the top-right corner.

## Running TestSim

To run TestSim in a browser window on your local machine, you will need to have npm and ReactJS installed. After cloning this repository, go to the main project directory and run:

### `npm start`

Using Chrome, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view TestSim in the browser.

You should see a Windows 10 desktop in your browser window. Try clicking on the icons in the task bar, moving windows around, and clicking on the side bar items.

Enjoy!
